# Gym-reminder
A reminder for the time in bewteen sets that you should take.
It is an app, that is on your phone that moneters your heart rate, in order to judge whether you are done with your set or not. When it deems you done with your set, it will set of a 60 second timer, as a sort of cooldown period until it notifies you it is time to start your new set. By using the apple watch/fitbit's system that can tract your heart rate if we just apply that to the app.
